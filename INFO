GitHub.
-------
Contents/Resources/. should be your working directory.
This is what the .gitignore is based off.
Create branches starting from this.

GitHub branching practice.
--------------------------
For each new changelist
git checkout -b <branch>
git fetch
git add ...
git commit ..
git push origin <branch>


Testing with GAE.
-----------------
Install AppEngine SDK
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/devenvironment

$ mkdir gae
$ cd gae
$ ln -s /Users/das/Downloads/web2py/web2py.app/Contents/Resources eventline
$ dev_appserver.py eventline/

http://127.0.0.1:8080 or whatever port app engine says its running on.

If all the above are done already:
change application in app.yaml
application: othaeventline 
to your testing one and deploy it.
It doesn't matter what it is for local testing.
