Testing with GAE.
-----------------
Install AppEngine SDK
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/devenvironment

$ mkdir gae
$ cd gae
$ ln -s /Users/das/Downloads/web2py/web2py.app/Contents/Resources eventline
$ dev_appserver.py eventline/

http://127.0.0.1:8080 or whatever port app engine says its running on.

If all the above are done already:
change application in app.yaml
application: othaeventline 
to your testing one and deploy it.
It doesn't matter what it is for local testing.
